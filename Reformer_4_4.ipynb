        "\n",
        "Recently, long sequence modeling has experienced a surge of interest as can be seen by the many submissions from this year alone - [Beltagy et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150), [Roy et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05997), [Tay et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11296), [Wang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04768) to name  a few. \n",
        "The motivation behind long sequence modeling is that many tasks in NLP, *e.g.* summarization, question answering, require the model to process longer input sequences than models, such as BERT, are able to handle. In tasks that require the model to process a large input sequence, long sequence models do not have to cut the input sequence to avoid memory overflow and thus have been shown to outperform standard \"BERT\"-like models *cf.* [Beltagy et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150). \n",

As a comparison, a conventional `bert-base-uncased` model limits the input length to only 512 tokens. In Reformer, each part of the standard transformer architecture is re-engineered to optimize for minimal memory requirement without a significant drop in performance.\n",

        "Let's imagine, we want to train a Reformer model on sequences of a length of up to 0.5M tokens and an input vector `config.hidden_size` of 1024 (see notebook [here](https://github.com/patrickvonplaten/notebooks/blob/master/PyTorch_Reformer.ipynb)). The corresponding positional embeddings have a size of $0.5M \\times 1024 \\sim 512M$ parameters, which corresponds to a size of 2GB.\n",

        "The Reformer authors managed to drastically shrink the positional encodings in size by cutting the `config.hidden_size` dimension in two and smartly factorizing the $n_\\text{max}$ dimension. In Transformer, the user can decide into which shape $n_\\text{max}$ can be factorized into by setting `config.axial_pos_shape` to an appropriate list of two values $n_\\text{max}^1$ and $n_\\text{max}^2$ so that $n_\\text{max}^1 \\times n_\\text{max}^2 = n_\\text{max}$. By setting `config.axial_pos_embds_dim` to an appropriate list of two values $d_h^1$ and $d_h^2$ so that $d_h^1 + d_h^2 = d_h$, the user can decide how the hidden size dimension should be cut. \n",

        "\n",
        "One can think of factorizing $n_\\text{max}$ as folding the dimension into a third axis, which is shown in the following for the factorization `config.axial_pos_shape = [7, 7]`:\n",

        "Now the idea is to use only one row of 7 encoding vectors and expand those vectors to the other 6 rows, essentially reusing their values. \n",
        "Because it is discouraged to have the same values for different encoding vectors, each vector of dimension (*a.k.a* height) `config.hidden_size=4` is cut into the lower encoding vector $\\mathbf{e}_\\text{down}$ of size $1$ and $\\mathbf{e}_\\text{up}$ of size $3$, so that the lower part can be expanded along the row dimension and the upper part can be expanded along the column dimension.\n",

Inversely, for the \"sub\"-vectors $\\mathbf{E}_\\text{up} = \\left[\\mathbf{e}_{\\text{up},1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{e}_{\\text{up},49}\\right]$ only the first column of $7$ is kept and expanded along the row dimension.\n",

The resulting axial positional encoding matrix would have had a size of only $1024 \\times 512 + 512 \\times 512 \\sim 800K$ parameters which corresponds to roughly 3MB. This is a drastic reduction from the 2GB a standard positional encoding matrix would require in this case.\n",
