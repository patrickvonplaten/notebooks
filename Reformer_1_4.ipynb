        "Recently, long sequence modeling has experienced a surge of interest as can be seen by the many submissions from this year alone - [Beltagy et al.

(2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05997), [Tay et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11296), [Wang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04768) to name  a few. \n",
        "The motivation behind long sequence modeling is that many tasks in NLP, *e.g.* summarization, question answering, require the model to process longer input sequences than models, such as BERT, are able to handle. In tasks that require the model to process a large input sequence, long sequence models do not have to cut the input sequence to avoid memory overflow and thus have been shown to outperform standard \"BERT\"-like models *cf.* [Beltagy et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150). \n",

As a comparison, a conventional `bert-base-uncased` model limits the input length to only 512 tokens. In Reformer, each part of the standard transformer architecture is re-engineered to optimize for minimal memory requirement without a significant drop in performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "Alright, now that we have understood how local self-attention works, we can take a stab at the probably most innovative piece of Reformer: **Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) Self-Attention**. \n",
        "\n",
        "The premise of LSH self-attention is to be more or less as efficient as local self-attention while approximating global self-attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "LSH self-attention relies on the LSH algorithm as presented in [Andoni et al (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02897), hence its name.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea behind LSH self-attention is based on the insight that if $n$ is large, the softmax applied on the $\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{K}^T$ attention dot-product weights only very few value vectors  with values significantly larger than 0 for each query vector. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's explain this in more detail.\n",
        "Let $\\mathbf{k}_i \\in \\mathbf{K} = \\left[\\mathbf{k}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{k}_n \\right]^T$ and $\\mathbf{q}_i \\in \\mathbf{Q} = \\left[\\mathbf{q}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{q}_n\\right]^T$ be the key and query vectors. For each $\\mathbf{q}_i$, the computation $\\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{q}_i^T \\mathbf{K}^T)$ can be approximated by using only those key vectors of $\\mathbf{k}_j$ that have a high cosine similarity with $\\mathbf{q}_i$. This owes to the fact that the softmax function puts exponentially more weight on larger input values.\n",
        "So far so good, the next problem is to efficiently find the vectors that have a\n",
        "high cosine similarity with $\\mathbf{q}_i$ for all $i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, the authors of Reformer notice that sharing the query and key projections: $\\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{K}$ does not impact the performance of a transformer model${}^1$. Now, instead of having to find the key vectors of high cosine similarity for each query vector $q_i$, only the cosine similarity of query vectors to each other has to be found. \n",
        "This is important because there is a transitive property to the query-query vector dot product approximation: If $\\mathbf{q}_i$ has a high cosine similarity to the query vectors $\\mathbf{q}_j$ and $\\mathbf{q}_k$, then $\\mathbf{q}_j$ also has a high cosine similarity to $\\mathbf{q}_k$. Therefore, the query vectors can be clustered into buckets, such that all query vectors that belong to the same bucket have a high cosine similarity to each other. Let's define $C_m$ as the *mth* set of position indices, such that their corresponding query vectors are in the same bucket: $C_m = \\{ i | \\text{ s.t. } \\mathbf{q}_i \\in \\text{mth cluster}\\}$ and `config.num_buckets`, *i.e.* $n_b$, as the number of buckets.\n",

        "\n",
        "Second, the authors make use of the **LSH** algorithm to cluster the query vectors into a predefined number of buckets $n_b$. The LSH algorithm is an ideal choice here because it is very efficient and is an approximation of the nearest neighbor algorithm for cosine similarity. Explaining the LSH scheme is out-of-scope for this notebook, so let's just keep in mind that for each vector $\\mathbf{q}_i$ the LSH algorithm attributes its position index $i$ to one of $n_b$ predefined buckets, *i.e.* $\\text{LSH}(\\mathbf{q}_i) = m$ with $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $m \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n_b\\}$.\n",

By chunking the permuted input, a bucket might be split into two different chunks. To remedy this problem, in LSH self-attention each chunk attends to its previous chunk `config.lsh_num_chunks_before=1` in addition to itself, the same way local self-attention does (`config.lsh_num_chunks_after` is usually set to 0). This way, we can be assured that all vectors in a bucket attend to each other with a high probability${}^3$.\n",

        "One important feature to mention here as well is that the accuracy of LSH self-attention can be improved by running LSH self-attention `config.num_hashes`, *e.g.* $n_h$ times in parallel, each with a different random LSH hash. \n",
        "By setting `config.num_hashes > 1`, for each output position $i$, multiple output vectors $\\mathbf{z}^{\\text{LSH}, 1}_i, \\ldots, \\mathbf{z}^{\\text{LSH}, n_h}_i$ are computed and subsequently merged: $\\mathbf{z}^{\\text{LSH}}_i = \\sum_k^{n_h} \\mathbf{Z}^{\\text{LSH}, k}_i * \\text{weight}^k_i$. The $\\text{weight}^k_i$ represents the importance of the output vectors $\\mathbf{z}^{\\text{LSH}, k}_i$ of hashing round $k$ in comparison to the other hashing rounds, and is exponentially proportional to the normalization term of their softmax computation. The intuition behind this is that if the corresponding query vector $\\mathbf{q}_i^{k}$ have a high cosine similarity with all other query vectors in its respective chunk, then the softmax normalization term of this chunk tends to be high, so that the corresponding output vectors $\\mathbf{q}_i^{k}$ should be a better approximation to global attention and thus receive more weight than output vectors of hashing rounds with a lower softmax normalization term. For more detail see Appendix A of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04451.pdf). For our example, multi-round LSH self-attention can be illustrated as follows.\n",

Because for large $n$, the number of buckets $\\frac{n_b}{2}$ grows much faster than the chunk length $l_c$, the user can again factorize the number of buckets `config.num_buckets` as explained [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/reformer.html#lsh-self-attention).\n",

        "1. We want to approximate global attention using the knowledge that the softmax operation only puts significant weights on very few key vectors.\n",
        "2. If key vectors are equal to query vectors this means that *for each* query vector $\\mathbf{q}_i$, the softmax only puts significant weight on other query vectors that are similar in terms of cosine similarity.\n",
        "3. This relationship works in both ways, meaning if $\\mathbf{q}_j$ is similar to $\\mathbf{q}_i$ than $\\mathbf{q}_j$ is also similar to $\\mathbf{q}_i$, so that we can do a global clustering before applying self-attention on a permuted input.\n",
        "4. We apply local self-attention on the permuted input and re-order the output to its original permutation.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "${}^{1}$ The authors run some preliminary experiments confirming that shared query key self-attention performs more or less as well as standard self-attention.\n",
        "\n",
        "${}^{2}$ To be more exact the query vectors within a bucket are sorted according to their original order. This means if, *e.g.* the vectors $\\mathbf{q}_1, \\mathbf{q}_3, \\mathbf{q}_7$ are all hashed to bucket 2, the order of the vectors in bucket 2 would still be $\\mathbf{q}_1$, followed by $\\mathbf{q}_3$ and $\\mathbf{q}_7$.\n",
        "\n",
        "${}^3$ On a side note, it is to mention the authors put a mask on the query vector $\\mathbf{q}_i$ to prevent the vector from attending to itself. Because the cosine similarity of a vector to itself will always be as high or higher than the cosine similarity to other vectors, the query vectors in shared query key self-attention are strongly discouraged to attend to themselves.\n",
